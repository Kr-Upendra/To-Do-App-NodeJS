# Task

Need to create a web application <b>To Do List</b> using nodejs, express and mongodb.

<br>
<br>

# About

This project was a task given by TGH. A To do list application, means where people can add to do and work on that after some times.

<br>
<br>

# Process

While reading about the given task first I thought it will be going to easy to make this but it wasn't. It takes 2 days of mine to think about functionallity and also about to think how I am gonna code it. Creating backend for this is easy enough just because of my nodejs skill.
<br>
I think creating front-end from scratch takes more time. Writing css is painfull but I have tried my best to make it cool and look better.

- ## Steps
  - First I have created backend for this.
  - Then goes for frontend parts.

<br>
<br>

# Used Techs

- To create backend I have used <b>Nodejs</b>, <b>Express</b> and for database I have used <b>Mongodb</b>.
- In frontend simple <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.

# Usefull Links

- Find backend application [backend](https://to-do-list-nodejs-yd7v.onrender.com)
- Find Frontend of Application [frontend](https://to-do-list-nodejs.netlify.app/)
- To Find all the todos at backend use this url [<b>backendBaseUrl/api/todos</b>]
- To Create a todos at backend use this url [<b>backendBaseUrl/api/todos</b>]
- To Update a todo at backend use this url [<b>backendBaseUrl/api/todos/:id</b>]
